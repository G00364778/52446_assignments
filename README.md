# Assignment 2018
## Fundamentals of Data Analysis

## How to run the notebook?

The notebook can be viewed and run in three difirent ways, directly on GitHub, on the official Jupyter Notebook viewer(nbviewer) or downloaded locally and run in Jupyter Notebook browser extension.

The GitHub viewer does not suppport all the standard features, like internal links and left aligned image rendering, so option two or three yields more desired results.
